				<h2>What is Studio Barre?</h2>
				
				<p>Studio Barre {strength. defined.} is a specialized barre workout class that focuses on building core strength, improving posture and developing long and lean muscles, like those of a dancer.</p>
				
				<p>Former professional dancer and fitness expert Shannon Higgins founded Studio Barre in 2012. Our mission is to give every client a results-oriented, full-body sculpting workout that is fun, effective and sassy. Walk into any Studio Barre for a community-loving barre class and walk out stronger, leaner and more confident.</p>
				
				<h2>Get Stronger</h2>
				
				<p>Studio Barre applies the perfect combination of arm, seat, thigh and ab exercises to define and sculpt the body. The 60-minute workout digs deep physically while the music and happy barre{tenders} keep you mentally in the moment and push you toward your best.</p>
				
				<h2>Get Leaner</h2>
				
				<p>Come to class once and feel a difference; come to class 3-4 times per week for a month and you will see a difference! Showing up to the barre consistently and regularly will create lean, long and strong muscles we all love. Our clients are proof that Studio Barre works.</p>
				
				<h2>Gain More Confidence</h2>
				
				<p>We help you build strong shoulders, core and back to literally raise you up. Stand taller and present a more confident stature. As you gain more strength, meet your goals and make new friends, your inner confidence matches your exterior. When you feel good, you look goodâ€¦ happy!</p>
